	Culture of the Kandi bracelets
</h3>
	
<p>
Kandi bracelets were first made and worn by drug dealers in the early 1990s. Drug dealers wore these bright bracelets so that other ravers could identify them and buy some of their product. The idea was, because at raves your hands are usually in the air, the dealers bright bracelets could be seen by everyone behind them and people would know they can buy drugs from him.
<br>

NOW

<br>

Kandi bracelets are worn by a large amount of ravers and the relationship with being drug-related has faded. These bracelets are now seen as a way for ravers to connect and symbolize unity among the rave community. Many kandi bracelets have the name of DJs a person has seen or festivals a person has been to. Others have positive sayings on them like peace and be happy. Trading or gifting your kandi to someone is a way of spreading your message and connecting with ravers all over the country.
<br>

There is a handshake that is performed when trading kandi with someone. The handshake symbolizes peace, love, unity, and respect (or, PLUR) through hand gestures. 
It goes as follows: the two people make peace signs and touch them (peace), each person forms their hand into half a heart and then are joined (love), then the two touch their hands in a gesture resembling a stop signal (unity), then they intertwine their fingers the way you would as if you are praying (respect), and finally, without releasing their grip, the other hand is used to move the bracelet from your wrist to theirs, and vice versa. Sometimes the two exchange a hug afterwards.
